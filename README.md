# Electric-Vehicle-Data-Analysis

Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis Project
This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) data to gain insights into various aspects of EV adoption, geographical distribution, manufacturer popularity, and future market growth. The analysis is conducted using Python programming language along with libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Electric Vehicle Population Data, stored in a CSV file named Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv.

Files
ev_data_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis.
Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv: CSV file containing the EV population data.
README.md: Readme file providing an overview of the project.
